# kinetic-surface-prototype

## Repository for the prototype of 5x5 Kinetic Surface System performing propagating sine wave , created by RIS & DigitalNativ

### Watch the system in action : [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XueYxyx6Xdw)

This system consists of :
- Rhinoceros 3D to visualize programmatically generated motion
- Grasshopper & c# as a toolkit to generate spatial sine wave motion
- Firefly as a toolkit to connect between Grasshopper & Arduino
- Arduino as physical controller
- Servo motor as actuators
- 3D Printed Rods & gear mechanisms
